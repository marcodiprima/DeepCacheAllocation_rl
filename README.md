The speed at which data flows over the network is expected to exceed the current capacity of the Internet in the near future. It thus becomes increasingly important to serve user requests, when possible, directly at the edge of the network, thus reducing upstream traffic, i.e. traffic from/to remote server locations. With this purpose, Edge Computing (EC) consists of the distribution of computational capabilities, e.g. RAM, CPU, storage, GPU, in nodes at the edge of the network.
The edge of the network is owned by the Network Operator (NO), which is the only one able to distribute resources. On the other hand, the services consumed by the latter, such as video streaming, are usually provided by third-party service providers (ISPs). And so the question is how to allow ISPs to run their applications close to users. The network operator virtualizes its computing resources at the edge, partitions them, and allocates them to ISPs (tenants).
In this project, I focus on one resource in particular, namely the \textit{Allocation Space}, which is particularly relevant: in fact, more than 80\% of Internet traffic could be represented by the delivery of content, especially video. Suppose the Network Operator owns the storage at the edge nodes and uses it as a cache. However, the NO cannot handle caching directly, as the traffic is encrypted \footnote{Everything is protected by an encryption algorithm to prevent unauthorized access} by the ISPs, so it is impossible for the NO, to know which objects are required, for example which ones are the most popular, nor if they are
also cacheable, such as online video transmission. We thus assume that the NO allocates the allocation of resources among the ISPs and allows each ISP to decide what to cache, within the allocated space.

My goal is to have NO decide, optimally how many cache slots should be assigned to each ISP, in order to minimize upstream traffic, i.e., traffic from the Internet to the edge node, without knowing the nature of the traffic. Because of the traffic encryption, the NO can only base its allocation decision on data-driven strategies consisting of trial and error: the NO continuously perturbs the cache allocation and observes the variation on the traffic.
This problem can be simulated with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Just as the NO learns to optimize the allocation by continually perturbing it, so too must I keep the cost of such perturbations reasonable.
